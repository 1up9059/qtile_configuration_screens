I am going to start looking at ideas from other tilers to see what would be nice to have in Qtile. 

Please add any tilers that are not among the lists below, and throw in any suggestions for layouts you would like to see in Qtile.

If you have any thoughts for improvements to existing layouts, please note them against the list of existing layouts.

## Tiling window manager lists

* [Arch Wiki - Comparison of Tiling Window Managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Comparison_of_Tiling_Window_Managers)
* [Wikipedia - Tiling Window managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager)

## Layouts of interest
### [Awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) Layouts

* columns - similar to the Tile layout in Qtile, but the tiles in the secondary section of the screen are organised similar to ratiotile.
* rows - the same, with rows instead of columns.
* magnified - focussed client is front and centre, all others are in a grid behind.
