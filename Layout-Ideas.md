I am going to start looking at ideas from other tiles to see what would be nice to have in Qtile. 

Please add any tilers that I have not among the lists below, and throw in any suggestions for layouts you would like to see in Qtile. 

## Tiling window manager lists

## Layouts of interest
### Awesome Layouts
    columns - similar to the Tile layout in Qtile, but the tiles in the secondary section of the screen are organised similar to ratiotile.
    rows - the same, with rows instead of columns.
    magnified - I quite like this one, keeps the focus at the centre of the screen
    floating - all windows on the screen set to floating,  I think this would be useful to have.
